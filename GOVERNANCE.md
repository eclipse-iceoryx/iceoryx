# Eclipse iceoryx governance

This document describes the processes additionally to the [Eclipse process](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/).

## Maintainers

An up to date list of the maintainers can be found at the [Eclipse project page](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.iceoryx/who).

### Meeting minutes

An Eclipse maintainer will save the meeting minutes on a new page for every meeting.
