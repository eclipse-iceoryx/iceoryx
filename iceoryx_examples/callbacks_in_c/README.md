# Listener in C (or how to use callbacks with iceoryx)

## Introduction

For a general introduction into the Listener concept please take a look at
the first part of the [Listener C++ example](../callbacks) and at the 
Glossary of the [WaitSet C++ example](../waitset).

## Code walkthrough

The C version of the callbacks example performs the identical tasks as the 
C++ version. We have again an application which offers two services called 
`Radar.FrontLeft.Counter` and `Radar.FrontRight.Counter`. Every time we have 
received a sample from each service we calculate the sum of it.

### ice_c_callbacks_publisher.c 

The publisher contains only already known iceoryx features. If some of them 
are not known to you please take a look at the [icedelivery in c example](../icedelivery_in_c).

### ice_c_callbacks_subscriber.c
#### int main()
The subscriber starts as usual by registering the process at the runtime.
In the next step we setup some `listenerStorage` on the stack where the listener 
will be constructed in and initialize the listener which will start a background 
thread for the upcoming event triggered callbacks.
```c
iox_listener_storage_t listenerStorage;
iox_listener_t listener = iox_listener_init(&listenerStorage);
```

Besides the subscribers we also would like to have an event which will be triggered 
by ourselfs - the `heartbeat`.
```c
iox_user_trigger_storage_t heartbeatStorage;
heartbeat = iox_user_trigger_init(&heartbeatStorage);
```

Both subscribers are having the same options which we setup with:
```c
iox_sub_options_t options;
iox_sub_options_init(&options);
options.historyRequest = 10U;
options.queueCapacity = 5U;
options.nodeName = "iox-c-callback-subscriber-node";
``` 

and then we can construct the two subscribers `subscriberLeft` and `subscriberRight`.
```c 
iox_sub_t subscriberLeft = iox_sub_init(&subscriberLeftStorage, "Radar", "FrontLeft", "Counter", &options);
iox_sub_t subscriberRight = iox_sub_init(&subscriberRightStorage, "Radar", "FrontRight", "Counter", &options);
```

Now that everything is initialized we start our `heartbeatTriggerThread` which 
triggers our `heartbeat` every 4 seconds.
```c 
pthread_t heartbeatTriggerThread;
if (pthread_create(&heartbeatTriggerThread, NULL, cyclicHeartbeatTrigger, NULL))
{
    printf("failed to create thread\n");
    return -1;
}
```

Attaching the subscribers and the heartbeat allows the Listener to call the callbacks 
whenever the event is signaled by the _EventOrigin_.
```c 
iox_listener_attach_user_trigger_event(listener, heartbeat, &heartbeatCallback);
iox_listener_attach_subscriber_event(listener, subscriberLeft, SubscriberEvent_HAS_DATA, &onSampleReceivedCallback);
iox_listener_attach_subscriber_event(
    listener, subscriberRight, SubscriberEvent_HAS_DATA, &onSampleReceivedCallback);
```
A user trigger can emit only one event therefore we do not provide the event type as 
an argument in the user trigger attach call.

Since we are following a push based approach - without an event loop which is pulling 
the events and processing them, we require a blocker which waits until a signal 
signals the process to terminate.
```c 
while (keepRunning)
{
    sleep_for(100);
}
```

When `keepRunning` is set to false we cleanup all the resources. First we detach
the events from the Listener. This is an optional step since the Listener detaches 
all events by itself when it is deinitialized. This goes also for all the _EventOrigins_,
if you for instance deinitialize an attached subscriber it will automatically detach 
itself from the Listener.
```c 
iox_listener_detach_user_trigger_event(listener, heartbeat);
iox_listener_detach_subscriber_event(listener, subscriberLeft, SubscriberEvent_HAS_DATA);
iox_listener_detach_subscriber_event(listener, subscriberRight, SubscriberEvent_HAS_DATA);
```

In a last step we have to release all acquired resources 
```c 
pthread_join(heartbeatTriggerThread, NULL);

iox_user_trigger_deinit(heartbeat);
iox_sub_deinit(subscriberLeft);
iox_sub_deinit(subscriberRight);
iox_listener_deinit(listener);
```

#### The callbacks
Every callback must have a signature like `void (iox_event_origin_t)`. Our 
`heartbeatCallback` just prints the message `heartbeat received` onto the console.
```c 
void heartbeatCallback(iox_user_trigger_t userTrigger)
{
    (void)userTrigger;
    printf("heartbeat received\n");
}
```

The `onSampleReceivedCallback` is a little bit more complex. First we acquire 
the chunk and then we have to find out which subscriber received the chunk. For that 
we acquire the service description of the subscriber and if its instance equals 
`FrontLeft` we store the chunk value in the `leftCache` otherwise in the `rightCache`.
```c 
void onSampleReceivedCallback(iox_sub_t subscriber)
{
    const struct CounterTopic* chunk;
    if (iox_sub_take_chunk(subscriber, (const void**)&chunk) == ChunkReceiveResult_SUCCESS)
    {
        iox_service_description_t serviceDescription = iox_sub_get_service_description(subscriber);
        if (strcmp(serviceDescription.instanceString, "FrontLeft") == 0)
        {
            leftCache.value = *chunk;
            leftCache.isSet = true;
        }
        else if (strcmp(serviceDescription.instanceString, "FrontRight") == 0)
        {
            rightCache.value = *chunk;
            rightCache.isSet = true;
        }
```

If both caches are set we can calculate the sum of both chunks and print them to
the console. To start fresh in the next cycle we reset the `leftCache` and 
the `rightCache` afterwards.
```c 
    if (leftCache.isSet && rightCache.isSet)
    {
        printf("Received samples from FrontLeft and FrontRight. Sum of %d + %d = %d\n",
               leftCache.value.counter,
               rightCache.value.counter,
               leftCache.value.counter + rightCache.value.counter);
        leftCache.isSet = false;
        rightCache.isSet = false;
    }
```
