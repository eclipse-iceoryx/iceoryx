# Listener in C (or how to use callbacks with iceoryx)

## Thread Safety

The Listener is thread-safe and can be used without restrictions.
But be aware that all provided callbacks are executed concurrently
in the background thread of the Listener. If you access structures
inside this callback you have to either ensure that you are the only
one accessing it or that it is accessed with a guard like a `mutex`.

## Introduction

For a general introduction into the Listener concept please take a look at
the first part of the
[Listener C++ example](https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx/tree/master/iceoryx_examples/callbacks) 
and at the Glossary of the
[WaitSet C++ example](https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx/tree/master/iceoryx_examples/waitset).

## Code Walkthrough

!!! attention
    Please be aware about the thread-safety restrictions of the _Listener_ and
    read the [Thread Safety](#thread-safety) chapter carefully.

The C version of the callbacks example performs the identical tasks as the
C++ version. We have again an application which offers two services called
`Radar.FrontLeft.Counter` and `Radar.FrontRight.Counter`. Every time we have
received a sample from each service we calculate the sum of it.

### ice_c_callbacks_publisher.c

The publisher contains only already known iceoryx features. If some of them
are not known to you please take a look at the 
[icedelivery in c example](https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx/tree/master/iceoryx_examples/icedelivery_in_c).

### ice_c_callbacks_subscriber.c

#### int main()

The subscriber starts as usual by registering the process at the runtime.
In the next step, we setup some `listenerStorage` on the stack where the listener
will be constructed and initialize the listener that will start a background
thread for the upcoming event-triggered callbacks.

```c
iox_listener_storage_t listenerStorage;
iox_listener_t listener = iox_listener_init(&listenerStorage);
```

Besides the subscribers we also would like to have an event that will be triggered
by our self - the `heartbeat`.

```c
iox_user_trigger_storage_t heartbeatStorage;
heartbeat = iox_user_trigger_init(&heartbeatStorage);
```

Both subscribers are having the same options which we setup with:

```c
iox_sub_options_t options;
iox_sub_options_init(&options);
options.historyRequest = 10U;
options.queueCapacity = 5U;
options.nodeName = "iox-c-callback-subscriber-node";
```

and then we can construct the two subscribers `subscriberLeft` and `subscriberRight`.

```c
iox_sub_t subscriberLeft = iox_sub_init(&subscriberLeftStorage, "Radar", "FrontLeft", "Counter", &options);
iox_sub_t subscriberRight = iox_sub_init(&subscriberRightStorage, "Radar", "FrontRight", "Counter", &options);
```

Now that everything is initialized, we start our `heartbeatTriggerThread` which
triggers our `heartbeat` every 4 seconds.

```c
pthread_t heartbeatTriggerThread;
if (pthread_create(&heartbeatTriggerThread, NULL, cyclicHeartbeatTrigger, NULL))
{
    printf("failed to create thread\n");
    return -1;
}
```

Attaching the subscribers and the heartbeat allows the Listener to call the callbacks
whenever the event is signaled by the _EventOrigin_.

```c
iox_listener_attach_user_trigger_event(listener, heartbeat, &heartbeatCallback);
iox_listener_attach_subscriber_event(listener, subscriberLeft, SubscriberEvent_DATA_RECEIVED, &onSampleReceivedCallback);
iox_listener_attach_subscriber_event(
    listener, subscriberRight, SubscriberEvent_DATA_RECEIVED, &onSampleReceivedCallback);
```

A user trigger can emit only one event therefore we do not provide the event type as
an argument in the user trigger attach call.

Since we are following a push-based approach - without an event loop that is pulling
the events and processing them, we require a blocker that waits until a signal
signals the process to terminate.

```c
while (keepRunning)
{
    sleep_for(100);
}
```

When `keepRunning` is set to false, we clean up all the resources. First, we detach
the events from the Listener. This is an optional step since the Listener detaches
all events by itself when it is deinitialized. This applies also for all the _EventOrigins_,
if you for instance deinitialize an attached subscriber it will automatically detach
itself from the Listener.

```c
iox_listener_detach_user_trigger_event(listener, heartbeat);
iox_listener_detach_subscriber_event(listener, subscriberLeft, SubscriberEvent_DATA_RECEIVED);
iox_listener_detach_subscriber_event(listener, subscriberRight, SubscriberEvent_DATA_RECEIVED);
```

In a last step we have to release all acquired resources

```c
pthread_join(heartbeatTriggerThread, NULL);

iox_user_trigger_deinit(heartbeat);
iox_sub_deinit(subscriberLeft);
iox_sub_deinit(subscriberRight);
iox_listener_deinit(listener);
```

#### The callbacks

Every callback must have a signature like `void (iox_event_origin_t)`. Our
`heartbeatCallback` just prints the message `heartbeat received` onto the console.

```c
void heartbeatCallback(iox_user_trigger_t userTrigger)
{
    (void)userTrigger;
    printf("heartbeat received\n");
}
```

The `onSampleReceivedCallback` is a little bit more complex. First we acquire
the chunk and then we have to find out which subscriber received the chunk. For that
we acquire the service description of the subscriber and if its instance equals
`FrontLeft` we store the chunk value in the `leftCache` otherwise in the `rightCache`.

```c
void onSampleReceivedCallback(iox_sub_t subscriber)
{
    const struct CounterTopic* userPayload;
    if (iox_sub_take_chunk(subscriber, (const void**)&userPayload) == ChunkReceiveResult_SUCCESS)
    {
        iox_service_description_t serviceDescription = iox_sub_get_service_description(subscriber);
        if (strcmp(serviceDescription.instanceString, "FrontLeft") == 0)
        {
            leftCache.value = *userPayload;
            leftCache.isSet = true;
        }
        else if (strcmp(serviceDescription.instanceString, "FrontRight") == 0)
        {
            rightCache.value = *userPayload;
            rightCache.isSet = true;
        }
```

If both caches are set, we can calculate the sum of both chunks and print them to
the console. To start fresh in the next cycle, we reset the `leftCache` and
the `rightCache` afterward.

```c
    if (leftCache.isSet && rightCache.isSet)
    {
        printf("Received samples from FrontLeft and FrontRight. Sum of %d + %d = %d\n",
               leftCache.value.counter,
               rightCache.value.counter,
               leftCache.value.counter + rightCache.value.counter);
        leftCache.isSet = false;
        rightCache.isSet = false;
    }
```
