# [NOT YET IMPLEMENTED] icedelivery in C - Transfer data between POSIX applications

**Hint** This example shows a work in progress. The API for the `publisher` and 
`subscriber` is finished but we still have to integrate the new building blocks
into RouDi. Till then whis C API will not work.

You can find a more detailled description of the C API in the [iceoryx_binding_c README.md](../../iceoryx_binding_c)

## The icedelivery example

The behavior and structure is identical to the [icedelivery C++ example](../icedelivery/) 
so that we explain here only the C API differences and not the 
underlying mechanisms.

### Subscriber

Like in the 
[icedelivery C++ example](../icedelivery/)
we again follow the steps like:
 
 1. Create runtime instance.
 2. Create subscriber port.
 3. Subscribe to the offered service 
 4. Receive data 
 5. Unsubscribe.
 6. **C API: Additionally, we have to remove the previously allocated Subscriber 
        port!** 

Let's take a look at the `receiving` function which comes with the
`ice_c_subscriber.c` example.

 1. We register our process at roudi with the name `iox-c-subscriber`
    ```c
    iox_runtime_register("/iox-c-subscriber");
    ```
  
 2. We create a subscriber port and are subscribing to the service 
    {"Radar", "FrontLeft", "Counter" }. Hereby the `historyRequest` 
    tells the subscriber how many previously send samples it should receive 
    right after the connection is established. These are
    samples which the publisher has send before the subscriber was 
    connected.
    The `subscriberStorage` is the place where the subscriber is stored in 
    memory and `subscriber` is actually a pointer to that location.
    ```c
    uint64_t historyRequest = 0u;
    iox_sub_storage_t subscriberStorage;
    iox_sub_t subscriber = iox_sub_init(&subscriberStorage, "Radar", "FrontLeft", "Counter", historyRequest);
    ```
 
  3. We subscribe to the service with a queue capacity of 10.
     ```c
     iox_sub_subscribe(subscriber, 10);
     ```

  4. In this loop we receive samples as long the `killswitch` is not
     set to `true` by an external signal and then print the counter 
     value to the console.
     ```c
     while (!killswitch)
     {
         if (SubscribeState_SUBSCRIBED == iox_sub_get_subscription_state(subscriber))
         {
             const void* chunk = NULL;
             while (ChunkReceiveError_SUCCESS == iox_sub_get_chunk(subscriber, &chunk))
             {
                 const struct CounterTopic* sample = (const struct CounterTopic*)(chunk);
                 printf("Receiving: %u\n", sample->counter);
                 iox_sub_release_chunk(subscriber, chunk);
             }
         }
         else
         {
             printf("Not subscribed!\n");
         }

         sleep_for(1000);
     }
     ```
  
  5. After we stop receiving samples we would like to unsubscribe.
     ```c
     iox_sub_unsubscribe(subscriber);
     ```

  6. When using the C API we have to cleanup the subscriber after 
     its usage.
     ```c
     iox_sub_deinit(subscriber);
     ```

### Publisher
The publisher is implemented in a way like in the
[icedelivery C++ example](../icedelivery/).

 1. Create runtime instance.
 2. Create publisher port.
 3. Offer the service 
 4. Send data 
 5. Stop offering the service
 6. **C API: Additionally, we have to remove the previously allocated Publisher 
        port!** 

Let's take a look at the `sending` function which comes with the
`ice_c_publisher.c` example.

 1. We register our process at roudi with the name `iox-c-subscriber`
    ```c
    iox_runtime_register("/iox-c-publisher");
    ```
 2. We create a publisher with the service 
    {"Radar", "FrontLeft", "Counter"}
    ```c
    uint64_t historyRequest = 0u;
    iox_pub_storage_t publisherStorage;
    iox_pub_t publisher = iox_pub_init(&publisherStorage, "Radar", "FrontLeft", "Counter", historyRequest);
    ```
 3. We offer our service to the world.
    ```c
    iox_pub_offer(publisher);
    ```

 4. Till an external signal sets `killswitch` to `true` we will send an
    incrementing number to all subscribers every send and print the
    value of this number to the console.
    ```c
    uint32_t ct = 0u;
    
    while (!killswitch)
    {
        void* chunk = NULL;
        if (AllocationResult_SUCCESS == iox_pub_allocate_chunk(publisher, &chunk, sizeof(struct CounterTopic)))
        {
            struct CounterTopic* sample = (struct CounterTopic*)chunk;
    
            sample->counter = ct;
    
            printf("Sending: %u\n", ct);
    
            iox_pub_send_chunk(publisher, chunk);
    
            ++ct;
    
            sleep_for(1000);
        }
        else
        {
            printf("Failed to allocate chunk!");
        }
    }
    ```

 5. We stop offering our service.
    ```c
    iox_pub_stop_offer(publisher);
    ```

 6. And we cleanup our publisher port.
    ```c
    iox_pub_destroy(publisher);
    ```
