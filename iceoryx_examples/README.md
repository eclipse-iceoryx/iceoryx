## Howto build the examples

To build the examples you can use the cmake configuration which is provided
in `iceoryx_meta`.
```sh 
cmake -Bbuild -Hiceoryx_meta -Dexamples=ON # by default the examples are always build
cd build 
make
```

To run an example switch into the `iceoryx_examples` directory which can be 
found in our build directory. Then select your example and follow the instructions
from the examples readme.

```sh 
cd build/iceoryx_examples/
cd someExample
./runExampleCode
```
