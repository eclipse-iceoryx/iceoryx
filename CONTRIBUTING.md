# Contributing to Eclipse iceoryx

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

In domains like automotive, robotics or gaming, a huge amount of data must be
transferred between different parts of the system. If these parts are actually
different processes on a POSIX based operating system like Linux, this huge
amount of data has to be transferred via an inter-process-communication (IPC)
mechanism.

## Feature request and bugs

We love pull requests! The next sections try to cover most of the relevant questions. For larger contributions or
architectural changes, we'd kindly ask you to get in touch with one of the maintainers beforehand. If you would like to
report a bug or propose a new feature, please raise an issue before raising a pull request. This makes it easier to
track. Please make sure you have:

1. Signed the [Eclipse Contributor Agreement](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php)
2. All branches have the following naming format: `iox-#123-this-is-a-branch`
3. All commits have the following naming format: `iox-#123 commit text`
4. All commits have been signed with `git commit -s`
5. You open your pull request towards the base branch `staging`
6. Link the pull request to the according Github issue and set the label accordingly

## Coding style

We love the [C++ core guidelines](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines). If in doubt please try
to follow them as well as our unwritten conventions in the existing parts of the code base.
Please format your code with the provided [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) and
[clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) before raising a pull request. Lots of IDEs do read the
clang-format file these days.

We created some convenient rules to highlight some bits that you might not be used to in other FOSS projects. They are
helpful to build embedded systems for safety fields like automotive or avionics. It is possible that not the whole
codebase follows these rules, things are work in progress.

1) **No heap is allowed**, static memory management hugely decreases the complexity of your software (e.g. cxx::vector
    without heap)
2) **No exception are allowed**, all function and methods need to have `noexcept` in their signature
3) **No undefined behavior**, zero-cost abstract is not feasible in high safety environments
4) **Use C++11**, however we try to introduce C++14 as fast as possible
5) **[Rule of Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(C%2B%2B_programming))**, if there is a non-default
    destructor needed, the rule of five has to be applied
6) **[STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library)**, we aim to be compatible towards the STL, but
    our code may contain additions which are not compatible with the STL (e.g. `iox::cxx::vector::emplace_back()`
    does return a bool)
7) **Always use `iox::log::Logger`**, instead of `printf()`
8) **Always use `iox::ErrorHandler()`**, instead of the direct STL calls

### Naming conventions

* File names with `lower_snake_case`: `my_thing.hpp`
* Structs, classes and enum classes in `UpperCamelCase`: `class MyClass{}`
* Methods and variables in `lowerCamelCase`: `uint16_t myVariable`
* Compile time constants, also enum values in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`: `static constexpr uint16_t MY_CONSTANT`
* Class members start with `m_`: `m_myMember`
* Namespaces in `lower_snake_case` : `my_namespace`

### Doxygen

Please use [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/) to document your code.

The following doxygen comments are required for public API headers:

    /// @brief short description
    /// @param[in] / [out] / [in,out] name description
    /// @return description

A good example for code formatting and doxygen structure is at [swe_docu_guidelines.md (WIP)](./doc/aspice_swe3_4/swe_docu_guidelines.md)

## Folder structure

The folder structure boils down to:

* iceoryx_COMPONENT
  * cmake: All cmakes files go here, needed for `find_pkg()`
  * doc: Manuals and documentation
  * include: public headers with stable API
    * internal: public headers with unstable API, which might change quite frequently
  * source: implementation files
  * test: unit and integrations tests
  * CMakeLists.txt: Build the component separately
* examples_iceoryx: Examples described in the main [Readme.md](./README.md#user-content-examples)

All new code should follow the folder structure.

## Testing

We use [Google test](https://github.com/google/googletest) for our unit and integration tests. We require compatibility
with the version 1.8.1.

### Unit tests (aka module tests)

Unit tests are black box tests that test the public interface of a class. They are required for all new code.

### Integration tests

Integration tests are composition of more than one class and test their interaction. They are optional for new code.

## Coverage Scan

To ensure that the provided testcode covers the productive code you can do a coverage scan with gcov. The reporting is done with lcov and htmlgen.
You will need to install the following packages:
    ```
    sudo apt install lcov
    ```

In iceoryx we have multiple testlevels for testcoverage: 'unit', 'integration', 'component' and ’all’ for all testlevels together. You can create reports for these different testlevels or for all tests. Coverage is done with gcc.
The coverage scan applies to Quality level 3 and partly level 2 with branch coverage.

For having a coverage report iceoryx needs to be compiled with coverage flags and the tests needs to be executed.
You can do this with one command like this:
    ```
    ./tools/iceoryx_build_test.sh clean -c <testlevel> -j 4
    ```

The -c flag indicates that you want to have a coverage report and you can pass there the needed testlevel. Per default the testlevel is set to 'all'.
example:
    ```
    ./tools/iceoryx_build_test.sh clean -c unit -j 4
    ```
For having only unittest reports. In the script tools/gcov/lcov_generate.sh is the initial scan, filtering and report generation automatically done.

All reports are stored in build/lcov as html report.

## Legal & Compliance

### Dependencies

* [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX)
Iceoryx aims to be fully POSIX-compliant towards the current revision POSIX.1-2017 (IEEE 1003.1-2017). Please write
your code as portable as possible. Currently our focus is [QNX](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en) (QCC 5.4) and Linux (GCC 7.5.0).

* [ACL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access-control_list)

* [ncurses](https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/)

### Safety & security

We aim for [ASIL-D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_Safety_Integrity_Level#ASIL_D) compliance. The
[ISO26262](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_26262) is also a good read-up if you want to learn more about automotive
safety. A nice introduction [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4GzsA00s5I) was presented on CppCon 2019.

If you want to report a vulnerability, please use the [Eclipse process](https://www.eclipse.org/security/).

We have a [partnership](https://www.perforce.com/blog/qac/why-eclipse-iceoryx-uses-helix-qac) with [Perforce](https://www.perforce.com) and use
[Helix QAC++ 2019.2](https://www.perforce.com/products/helix-qac) to perform a static-code analysis.

Github [labels](https://github.com/eclipse/iceoryx/labels) are used to group issues into the rulesets:

| Ruleset name | Github issue label |
|---|---|
| [MISRA](https://www.misra.org.uk/) C++ 2008 | MISRA |
| [Adaptive AUTOSAR](https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/adaptive/17-03/AUTOSAR_RS_CPP14Guidelines.pdf) C++14 | AUTOSAR |
| [SEI CERT C++](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=88046682) 2016 Coding Standard | CERT |

If one of the rules is not followed, a rationale is added in the following manner:

With a comment in the same line:

    *mynullptr = foo; // PRQA S 4242 # Short description why

With a comment one line above (with the number after the warning number, next ’n’ lines are inclusive)

    // PRQA S 4242 1 # Short description why
    *mynullptr = foo;

Don't be afraid if you don't have Helix QAC++ available. As we want to make it easy for developers to contribute,
please use the ``staging`` branch and we'll run the QAC++ scan and get back to you.

Results will be available on this [Helix QAC dashboard](https://qaverify.programmingresearch.com/). Please contact one
of the maintainers, if you're interested in getting access.

It is possible that not the whole codebase follows these rules, things are work in progress. But this is where we want
go. As of now we don't have any continuos integration checks implemented but will rely on reviews during the pull
requests. We're planning to introduce continuos integration checks in the near future.

## Quality levels

CMake targets can be developed according to different quality levels. Despite developing some of our targets according
to automotive standards like ISO26262, the code base standalone does NOT legitimize the usage in a safety critical
system. All requirements of a lower quality level are included in higher quality levels e.g. quality level 4 is
included in quality level 3.

Also see [ROS quality levels](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep/blob/master/rep-2004.rst).

* No version policy required
* No unit tests required

### Quality level 4

This quality level is meant for all targets that need tier 1 support in ROS2.

* Basic unit tests are available

### Quality level 3

* No compiler warnings
* Doxygen and documentation available
* Test specification available
* Version policy required
* Level 8 and 9 warnings in Helix QAC addressed

### Quality level 2
