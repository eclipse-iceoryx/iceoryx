/// @brief The Listener is a class which reacts to registered events by
///        executing a corresponding callback concurrently. This is achieved via
///        an encapsulated thread inside this class.
/// @note  The Listener is threadsafe and can be used without any restrictions concurrently.
/// @attention Calling detachEvent for the same event from multiple threads is supported but
///            can cause a race condition if you attach the same event again concurrently from
///            another thread.
///            Example:
///             1. One calls detachEvent [1] from thread A, B and C
///             2. thread B wins and detaches event [1]
///             3. A new thread D spawns and would like to attach event [1] again while thread A and C are
///                 still waiting to detach [1].
///             4. Thread A wins but cannot detach event [1] since it is not attached.
///             5. Thread D wins and attaches event [1].
///             6. Finally thread C can continue and detaches event [1] again.
///
///            If thread D is executed last then the event is attached. So depending on the operating
///            system defined execution order the event is either attached or detached.
///
///            Best practice: Detach a specific event only from one specific thread and not
///                           from multiple contexts.
