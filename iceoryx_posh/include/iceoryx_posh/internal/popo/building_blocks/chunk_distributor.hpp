/// @brief The ChunkDistributor is the low layer building block to send SharedChunks to a dynamic number of ChunkQueus.
/// Together with the ChunkQueuePusher, the ChunkDistributor builds the infrastructure to exchange memory chunks between
/// different data producers and consumers that could be located in different processes. Besides a modifiable container
/// of ChunkQueues to which a SharedChunk can be deliverd, it holds a configurable history of last sent chunks. This
/// allows to provide a newly added queue a number of last chunks to start from. This is needed for functionality
/// known as latched topic in ROS or field in ara::com. A ChunkDistributor is used to build elements of higher
/// abstraction layers that also do memory managemet and provide an API towards the real user
///
/// About Concurrency:
/// This ChunkDistributor can be used with different LockingPolicies for different scenarios
/// When different threads operate on it (e.g. application sends chunks and RouDi adds and removes queues),
/// a locking policy must be used that ensures consistent data in the ChunkDistributorData.
/// @todo iox-#1713 There are currently some challenges:
/// For the stored queues and the history, containers are used which are not thread safe. Therefore we use an
/// inter-process mutex. But this can lead to deadlocks if a user process gets terminated while one of its
/// threads is in the ChunkDistributor and holds a lock. An easier setup would be if changing the queues
/// by a middleware thread and sending chunks by the user process would not interleave. I.e. there is no concurrent
/// access to the containers. Then a memory synchronization would be sufficient.
/// The cleanup() call is the biggest challenge. This is used to free chunks that are still held by a not properly
/// terminated user application. Even if access from middleware and user threads do not overlap, the history
/// container to cleanup could be in an inconsistent state as the application was hard terminated while changing it.
/// We would need a container like the UsedChunkList to have one that is robust against such inconsistencies....
/// A perfect job for our future selves
