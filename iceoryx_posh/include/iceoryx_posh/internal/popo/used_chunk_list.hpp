/// @brief This class is used to keep track of the chunks currently in use by the application.
///        In case the application terminates while holding chunks, this list is used by RouDi to retain ownership of
///        the chunks and prevent a chunk leak.
///        In order to always be able to access the used chunks, neither a vector or list can be used, because these
///        container could be corrupted when the application dies in the wrong moment.
///        To be able to do the cleanup, RouDi needs to be able to access the list with the used chunk under all
///        circumstances. This is achieved by storing the ChunkManagement pointer in an array which can always be
///        accessed. Additionally, the type stored is this array must be less or equal to 64 bit in order to write it
///        within one clock cycle to prevent torn writes, which would corrupt the list and could potentially crash
///        RouDi.
