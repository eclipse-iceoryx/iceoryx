/// @brief This pattern can be used if you write an abstraction where you have
///        to throw an exception in the constructor when you for instance would
///        like to manage a resource and the constructor was unable to acquire
///        that resource.
///        In this case you inherit from `Creation` and your class has three more
///        static factory methods - `create`, `placementCreate` and `verify`.
///        `create` forwards all arguments to the underlying class constructor and
///        if the construction was successful an expected containing the type is
///        returned, otherwise an error value which describes the error.
///        Additionally, this class is providing two protected member variables
///        `m_isInitialized` and `m_errorValue`. The user always has to set
///        `m_isInitialized` to true when the object construction was successful
///        otherwise one sets it to false and write the corresponding error cause
///        in the provided `m_errorValue` variable which is then returned to
///        the user.
/// @code
///   enum class MyResourceAbstractionError {
///     ResourceNotAvailable,
///     BlaBlubError
///   };
