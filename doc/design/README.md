# Design Documents

In here you can find design documents to all constructs of iceoryx. At the 
moment those design documents are neither complete nor final.

In [draft](./draft/) are design drafts of current features contained which are under 
implementation. The goal is to provide other developers a first idea on how 
the feature can be used and how it will be implemented.
