# Installation

All iceoryx libraries are deployed as independent CMake packages. Posh is using functions from hoofs and is depending on it. You are able to build posh and hoofs and integrate them into existing CMake projects.

## Prerequisites

### Dependencies

- 64-bit hardware (e.g. x86_64 or aarch64; 32-bit hardware might work, but is not supported)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org), 3.16 or later
- One of the following compilers:
    - [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org), 8.3 or later
    - [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org), 9.0 or later
    - [MSVC](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/), part of Visual Studio 2019 or later
- [libacl](http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/acl/), 2.2 or later. Only for Linux & QNX.
- optional, [ncurses](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/), 6.2 or later. Required by introspection tool (only for Linux, QNX and MacOS).

### Mac OS

Before installing iceoryx you need to install XCode and git. Optionally, ncurses library is required for
the introspection client. To install ncurses locally into your build folder follow these steps

```bash
cd iceoryx
ICEORYX_DIR=$PWD
mkdir -p build
cd build
git clone https://github.com/mirror/ncurses.git
cd ncurses
git checkout v6.2
./configure  --prefix=$ICEORYX_DIR/build/dependencies/ --exec-prefix=$ICEORYX_DIR/build/dependencies/ --with-termlib
make -j12
make install
```

### Linux

Although we strive to be fully POSIX-compliant, we recommend using Ubuntu 20.04 and at least GCC 8.3 for development.

You will need to install the following packages:

```bash
sudo apt install gcc g++ cmake libacl1-dev libncurses5-dev pkg-config
```

To build iceoryx as 32-bit library, the following packages need to be installed additionally:

```bash
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt install libacl1-dev:i386 libc6-dev-i386 libc6-dev-i386-cross libstdc++6-i386-cross gcc-multilib g++-multilib
```

Additionally, there is an optional dependency to the [cpptoml](https://github.com/skystrife/cpptoml) library, which is used to parse the RouDi config file containing mempool configuration.

### QNX

QNX SDP 7.1 is supported (shipping with gcc 8.3 respectively).

The easiest way to build iceoryx on QNX is by using the build script and providing a toolchain file.
We provide generic QNX SDP 7.0 toolchain files for ARM_64 and X86_64 in `./tools/toolchains/qnx` ([Direct Link](../../../tools/toolchains/qnx)).

ARM_64:

```bash
./tools/iceoryx_build_test.sh -t /home/user/toolchains/qnx/qnx_sdp70_aarch64le.cmake
```

X86_64:

```bash
./tools/iceoryx_build_test.sh -t /home/user/toolchains/qnx/qnx_sdp70_x86_64.cmake
```

!!! attention
    Please ensure that the folder `/var/lock` exist and the filesystem supports file locking.

### Windows

In case you do not have a Windows installation, Microsoft provides free developer images from [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/).

Additionally, [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) and [git](https://gitforwindows.org/) are required. The option to add CMake to the system PATH for all users should be set when it is installed.

Alternatively, [chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org) can be used to install the dev dependencies. Follow the instructions for the [individual install](https://chocolatey.org/install#individual) and then use the following commands to install `git` and `cmake`.
```powershell
choco install -y git
choco install -y cmake --installargs 'ADD_CMAKE_TO_PATH=System'
```
Additional packages can be found [here](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages).

#### Setup for MSVC

If the developer image from Microsoft is used, Visual Studio Community 2022 is already installed, else it can be found [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/).

To be able to compile iceoryx, the `Desktop development with C++` Workload must be installed. This is done by running `VisualStudioInstaller` and selecting the `Modify` button on `Visual Studio Community 2022`.

Either `VS Code` or `Developer Command Prompt` can be used to build iceoryx with CMake. Maybe one or two restarts are required to let CMake find the compiler.

Alternatively, `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat` can be executed in any shell to setup all the paths for compilation.

!!! attention
    A Windows SDK Version of at least `10.0.18362.0` is required.

#### Setup for MinGW

`MinGW` can also be used to build iceoryx on Windows. The easist way to do this is to use `chocolatey`.

```powershell
choco install -y mingw --version=10.3.0
```

The `MinGW` library path needs to be added to the `Path` environment variable.
```powershell
$env:Path += 'C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\mingw\tools\install\mingw64\bin'
```

## Build with CMake

!!! note
    Building with CMake is the preferred way, for more complex actions like a coverage scan
    is a script available (see chapter below).

The `CMakeLists.txt` from `iceoryx_meta` can be used to easily develop iceoryx with an IDE.

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx.git
    ```

2. Generate the necessary build files

    ```bash
    cd iceoryx
    cmake -Bbuild -Hiceoryx_meta
    # when you have installed external dependencies like ncurses you have to add them
    # to your prefix path
    cmake -Bbuild -Hiceoryx_meta -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$(PWD)/build/dependencies/
    ```

    On Windows, the commands are
    ```powershell
    # for MSVC
    cmake -Bbuild -Hiceoryx_meta -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="/MP" -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION="10.0.18362.0"

    # for MinGW
    cmake -Bbuild -Hiceoryx_meta -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION="10.0.18362.0" -G "MinGW Makefiles"
    ```

    !!! tip
        To build all iceoryx components add `-DBUILD_ALL=ON` to the CMake command. For Windows it is currently recommended to use the `cmake -Bbuild -Hiceoryx_meta -DBUILD_TEST=ON -DINTROSPECTION=OFF -DBINDING_C=ON -DEXAMPLES=ON` instead

3. Compile the source code

    ```bash
    cmake --build build
    ```

    !!! tip
        You can speed up the build by appending `-j 4` where 4 stands for the number of parallel build processes.
        You can choose more or less depending on your available CPU cores on your machine.

4. Install to system

    Mac:

    ```bash
    cmake --build build --target install
    ```

    Linux:

    ```bash
    sudo cmake --build build --target install
    ```

    !!! tip
        The installation directory is usually left at its default, which is `/usr/local`

    !!! note
        iceoryx is built in release mode as static library with `-O3` optimization by default. If you want to enable debug symbols please set `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Deb`.

### Build options

Please take a look at the CMake file [build_options.cmake](../../../iceoryx_meta/build_options.cmake)
to get an overview of the available build options for enabling additional features.

If systemd support is enabled `-DUSE_SYSTEMD=ON`, the unit file may look like this:

````bash
#$ vim /usr/lib/systemd/system/test_iceoryx.service
[Unit]
Description=Test application roudi

[Service]
Type=notify
User=roma
RestartSec=10
Restart=always
ExecStart=/usr/bin/iox-roudi
TimeoutStartSec=10
WatchdogSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

````
Do not forget to do this after adding the unit file `systemctl daemon-reload`

Launch example `systemctl start test_iceoryx`

Example of a stop `systemctl stop test_iceoryx`

## Build with script

As an alternative, we provide a build-test script which we use to integrate iceoryx into our infrastructure.
The intention of the script goes beyond building iceoryx, it is also used for the code coverage scan or the address-sanitizer runs on the CI.
The script currently works for Linux and QNX only, it is planned to offer a multi-platform solution.

 1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx.git
    ```

 2. Build everything

    ```bash
    cd iceoryx
    ./tools/iceoryx_build_test.sh build-all
    ```

    !!! note
        The build script is installing the header files and binaries into `build/install/prefix`.

You can use the `help` argument for getting an overview of the available options:

```bash
./tools/iceoryx_build_test.sh help
```

!!! tip
    The examples can be built with `-DEXAMPLES=ON` with iceoryx_meta or by providing the `examples` argument to the build script.

## Build with colcon

Alternatively, iceoryx can be built with [colcon](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/user/installation.html#using-debian-packages) to provide a smooth integration for ROS 2 developers.
To build the iceoryx_integrationtest package one requires a minimal [ROS 2 installation](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Linux-Install-Debians.html).

Install required ROS 2 packages:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-foxy-ros-testing ros-foxy-ros-base
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
```

build with colcon:

```bash
mkdir -p iceoryx_ws/src
cd $_
git clone https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx.git
cd ..
colcon build
```

!!! note
    If you don't want to install ROS 2, you can skip the iceoryx_integrationtest package by calling:

    ```bash
    colcon build --packages-skip iceoryx_integrationtest
    ```

This build method makes the most sense in combination with [rmw_iceoryx](https://github.com/ros2/rmw_iceoryx.git)

## Build with Bazel

A second option is to build iceoryx with [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) as an alternative build and test tool.
In comparison to CMake it offers an easier syntax with better performance and a hermetic build mode for reproducible builds.

To install Bazel you can use [Bazelisk](https://bazel.build/install/bazelisk).
Bazel uses workspaces and BUILD files to set up the infrastructure. You will notice
that in the root directory of iceoryx a `WORKSPACE` is added that defines the workspace folder.
In general, a Bazel workspace contains the project-specific source code and build outputs.
In the corresponding iceoryx modules (e.g. iceoryx_hoofs) you will find `BUILD` files
that contain instructions for Bazel to build and test targets.<cite>[[1]]</cite>

[1]: https://bazel.build/install/bazelisk

To build a specific target with Bazel you can use the `bazel build` command:

```bash
cd iceoryx
bazel build //iceoryx_posh:iox-roudi
```

The `//iceoryx_posh` argument is the location of the BUILD file for the package.
BUILD files can be seen similar to CMakeLists.txt files where the build targets are defined.
The `iox-roudi` separated by a colon is the actual target defined in the BUILD file.

!!! tip
    Using `bazel build //...` will build all Bazel targets.

!!! note
    The names for iceoryx targets like libraries, applications and test are the same as in the CMake build system.

You will notice that four additional `bazel-*` folders are created in the iceoryx root folder.
They contain the build artifacts and test log. Bazel compiles the libraries always static and
dynamic and place them into the `bazel-out` folder.

Executing tests with Bazel is similar like building:

```bash
cd iceoryx
bazel test //iceoryx_hoofs/test:hoofs_moduletests
```

!!! tip
    Using `bazel test //...` will run all tests defined in Bazel.

!!! note
    Logs and generated XML files with the results are automatically created and
    stored within the `bazel-testlogs` folder.

Bazel offers the possibility to execute binaries:

```bash
cd iceoryx
bazel run //iceoryx_posh:iox-roudi
```

!!! tip
    Calling `bazel test` or `bazel run` directly without a previous `bazel build` is possible and will build the necessary targets automatically.

The support for Bazel in iceoryx is work in progress but the most important libraries and applications are covered.
Ideas and Remarks are always welcome, feel free to create an issue or discussion on the GitHub repository.
