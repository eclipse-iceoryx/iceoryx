/// @brief A static memory replacement for std::function
///        Allows storing a callable with a given signature if its size does not exceed a limit.
///        This limit can be adjusted by changing the Bytes parameter.
///        In contrast to iox::function_ref iox::function objects own everything needed
///        to invoke the underlying callable and can be safely stored.
///        They also support copy and move semantics in natural way
///        by copying or moving the underlying callable.
///
///        Similarly to std::function, they cannot be stored in Shared Memory
///        to be invoked in a different process.
///
///        For the API see storable_function.
///
/// @tparam Signature The signature of the callable to be stored, e.g. int (char, void*).
/// @tparam Capacity The static storage capacity available to store a callable in bytes.
///
/// @note  If the static storage is insufficient to store the callable we get a compile time error.
